System description

Every academic institution has a teaching staff. For each lecturer we will keep his name, social security number, his highest degree (first, second, doctor, professor)
as well as his field of specialization. The faculty of lecturers is divided into permanent lecturers and external lecturers. A permanent lecturer receives a salary 12
months a year, and it varies according to his seniority at the institution. Also, a permanent faculty member should also belong to at least one committee in the
college (exceptions, teaching committee, learning improvement committee, and there will definitely be more committees later). A lecturer from abroad receives an
hourly rate, according to a personal employment contract, but it must be ensured that he does not work more than 14 hours.
The academic faculties are united separately in labor unions (that is, a union for permanent lecturers, and a union for lecturers from abroad). Each such union
has bylaws and has a chairman from among its members. It must be allowed to add and remove lecturers of the appropriate type for each of the unions.
The system will make it possible to know which lecturers' union is "stronger", when the strength of the union is determined according to the union with the largest number
of members.
The college has a database of all its lecturers. The college wants to be able to send messages comprehensively to all lecturers (for example, about
remote learning due to Corona, return to regular teaching, etc.). In addition, during the holidays, the college gives a monetary gift through the pay slip
to the lecturers: permanent lecturers receive NIS 500 and external lecturers receive NIS 350.
